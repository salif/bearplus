# Zola Bear+ Theme

Minimalistic yet a bit featureful theme for the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site generator.

## Installation

If you already have a Zola site on your machine, you can simply add this theme via
```
git submodule add https://github.com/salif/bearplus themes/bearplus
```
